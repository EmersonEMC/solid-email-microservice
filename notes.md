# Email Microservice getting started

>> Services we'll make this work with

- Nodemailer 
- Mailjet = https://app.mailjet.com/transactional/sendapi
- Sendgrid (we'll use all of these)

### Folder structure
- src (we store all of our application code here)
- bin (this is where we put our startup files for when we want to deploy this)
